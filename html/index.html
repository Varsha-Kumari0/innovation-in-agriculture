                <h1>Van Mahotsav in SLIET</h1>
                <p>Our college recently celebrated Van Mahotsav with great enthusiasm and fervor. The aim of the event
                    was to spread awareness about the significance of trees in our lives and to encourage students to
                    take up tree plantation drives.
                    The event began with a plantation drive, where students, faculty members, and staff planted saplings
                    in the college campus. The Club had arranged for a variety of saplings, including fruit trees,
                    medicinal plants, and ornamental plants, to be planted. The students were given a brief on the
                    importance of each of the plants and how they contribute to the environment.

                <h1>Tree Plantation</h1>
                <p>Tree plantation is a simple yet effective way to contribute to the well-being of our environment.
                    Trees are not only aesthetically pleasing but also play a vital role in maintaining ecological
                    balance. They purify the air and provide shade. Additionally, trees also help prevent soil erosion, support
                    biodiversity, and provide habitat for a wide range of species.
                    As a college community, we can come together and make a positive impact on our environment by
                    planting trees on Independence Day. This activity can not only help improve our surroundings but
                    also instill a sense of responsibility and pride among the students and staff.
